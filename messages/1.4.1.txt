                CHANGELOG

1.4.1:
    This update primarily focuses on per-project configuration.

    - NEW:
      - Added support for embedded auto-detect formatter config within the
        "Formatter.sublime-settings" file. Auto-detect formatting will read
        config from embedded and/or dot files.
      - Added support for per-project formatting using ".sublime-project" files.

      The README.md and Github repo were updated to reflect these changes.

    - FIXES:
      None

    - Added new modules:
      None
