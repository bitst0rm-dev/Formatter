                CHANGELOG

1.1.2:
    - Fix: Removed session syntax completely from session manager (ref #39)
      The "remember_session" option now only handles:
        1. cursor position
        2. selections
        3. bookmarks
      You can set "remember_session": true without encountering
      issues with syntax packages.

    - Added new modules:
      rustfmt
