                CHANGELOG

1.1.1:
    - Introduced a new option: format_on_unique
      This option addresses the syntaxes conflict related to
      "format_on_save" and "format_on_paste"
      Use this when you have multiple plugins with the same syntaxes.
      see: Preferences > ... > Formatter > Settings

    - Introduced a new feature: Backup and Restore Settings
      This allows you to backup your Formatter settings,
      including individual plugin config files.
      see: Preferences > ... > Formatter

    - Added new modules:
      Gofmt, Goimports, Gofumpt, ShellCheck, Artistic Style, autopep8

    - Various improvements
