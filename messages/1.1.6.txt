                CHANGELOG

1.1.6:
    - Fix: Prevent spawning of an insecure shell on Windows.
      This addresses an issue where, on certain Windows
      versions, command arguments were not retained.
      (closed #44) Thanks h2110100 for testing.

    - Updated the obsolete clang-format arguments
