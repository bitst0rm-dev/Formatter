                CHANGELOG

1.3.3:
    This update primarily focuses on resolving "interpreter_path"
    in environments where an interpreter doesn't need to be invoked
    like Anaconda. Starting from this version, the "interpreter_path"
    will only be used if explicitly specified for use in Formatter.
    The "interpreter_path" can take the form of either
    ["autopep8"] or ["/path/to/bin/autopep8"] for example.

    - NEW:
      None

    - FIXES:
      - refine interpreter_path (ref #45) Thanks @asparc

    - Added new modules:
      None
