                CHANGELOG

1.2.1:
    - NEW:
      - Added a "status" flag to the "debug" option. You might want to use this
        flag as it only displays results regarding to the actual formatting.
        Accepted values: true (verbose), false, OR "status" (minimal info)

    - FIX:
      - Minor code optimization.

    - Added new modules:
      sqlparse, pg_format, stylefmt, scalariform, zigfmt, pyment, docformatter
