                CHANGELOG

1.1.10:
    - Changes in settings (ref #45):
      "interpreter_path" and "executable_path" can now be either a string or a list:
      You do not need to take any action, if they are still of type string in previous versions.
      Formatter will convert string to list internally.
      Using a list provides more flexibility in searching the path on various systems.
      Here the updated settings with explantation:

      // Path to the third-party plugin executable to process formatting.
      // This option can be either a string or a list of executable paths.
      // - If this option is omitted or set to null, then the global executable
      //   on PATH will be used, if found.
      // - If this option is exactly the basename, then it will be used as the
      //   executable name and searched for on the PATH.
      "executable_path": "/path/to/bin/foo", previous versions OR
      "executable_path": ["/path/to/bin/foo"], newer versions
      "executable_path": ["foo", "bar"], Using basename (e.g: foo for Win, bar for Mac)

    - Added new modules:
      R styler, formatR, caddy-fmt, Clojure zprint
