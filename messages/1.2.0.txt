                CHANGELOG

1.2.0:
    - NEW:
      Formatter introduces a new generic method to simplify the process of
      adding new third-party plugins:
        - Generic method: simple, no need coding or submitting pull request,
                          using just a portion json dict to add plugins.
                          This method should be able to handle most plugins.
        - Modules method: advanced, needs coding in form of integration of
                          python modules or submitting pull request.
                          This method should be able to hack deeper where
                          the Generic method cannot.
      The README.md and Github repo were updated to reflect these changes.
      Please see the Configuration section to read guide, if needed.

    - FIX:
      - Removed the obsolete compatibility check (closes #47)
      - Reading none-existing settings file
      - Removed Quick Options format on unique (adjustable in setting file)
      - Other minor improvements

    - Added new modules:
      nginxfmt, bibtex-tidy
