                CHANGELOG

1.3.0:
    - NEW:
      - Implementation of Text-to-Image mode:
        Usage is the same as Text-to-Text.

        With Text-to-Image, Text-to-Text, and the ability to add
        new custom formatters using Generic and Modules methods,
        Formatter has reached its latest milestone today.

        While new features may be added later, but they are not
        currently urgently planned.
        The README.md and Github repo were updated to reflect these changes.

    - FIX:
      - Fix warning mnemonic not found in menu caption (closes #49) Thanks @asparc
      - Other improvements

    - Added new modules:
      d2 fmt, d2 (graphic), mermaid (graphic)
